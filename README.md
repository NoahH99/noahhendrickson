Welcome to **noahendrickson.com** â€“ my personal website and learning playground! This project is a full-stack web 
application built with a microservices architecture, designed for both exploration and personal growth. I plan to 
use this project to deepen my understanding of distributed systems, authentication, and service communication, 
as well as to showcase some of my work and interests.
